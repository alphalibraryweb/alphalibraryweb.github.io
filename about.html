        <div id="abt">
            <p style="text-align:center;margin:auto;">At 5:10PM on September 26th 2024 [UTC], Vix posted on the OpenXP Discord server asking users to Direct Message him if they were interested in a project to "archiving and documenting windows betas iso[s]" - this would lead to the creation of the δ Catalog later on.</p><br>
            <p style="text-align:center;margin:auto;">On the 7th October 2024, BetaWeb was created by <a href='https://github.com/techguy16'>techguy16</a> as a way to find downloads for beta builds of software, mainly Windows. The first version of the website was released that same day.</p><br>
            <p style="text-align:center;margin:auto;">On October 23rd 2024, Vix created the δ Catalog (commonly known as the Delta Catalog). He announced it on the OpenXP Discord on that day.</p><br>
            <p style="text-align:center;margin:auto;">On November 8th 2024, the δ Catalog was mysteriously deleted, and later that day, <a href='https://github.com/Adrikikicp2'>Adrikikicp</a> and <a href='https://github.com/techguy16'>techguy16</a> formed Αlphα λibrary, and rebranded all BetaWeb assets to use that name. On the 18th November 2024 [UTC], Alpha λibrary's provisional wiki was launched.</p>
